# Binary Search Tree (BST) Creation from Array
## Overview:
This Python script demonstrates the creation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) from a given array. The script defines a TreeNode class to represent each node in the tree, and it includes functions for inserting elements into the tree and printing the tree in an inorder traversal.

## Usage:
Define TreeNode Class:
The TreeNode class is used to represent each node in the Binary Search Tree. It contains attributes for the left child, right child, and the value of the node.

## Insert Function:
The insert function inserts a new element into the BST while maintaining the BST properties.

## Print Tree Function:
The print_tree function performs an inorder traversal of the BST and prints the elements in sorted order.

## Creating BST from Array:
To create a BST from a given array, the script iterates through the array elements, inserting each element into the BST.

### Notes:
- This script is a basic example of creating a Binary Search Tree from an array.
- The TreeNode class and functions can be extended for more complex use cases.
- Feel free to use and modify the code as needed for your specific requirements.
